whack-a-mole
============

Whack-a-Mole game written in C++ (with SDL2/SDL_image).

Project Title: 			Whack-A-Mole (wam) v0.3

Project Developer: 		Isaac Hernandez

Project Date:			February 2014

Project Compatibility:		Only Windows.

Project Description:	Whack-A-Mole is my first attempt at using C++, SDL2, and SDL_image to create a game. My previous games were all created using GameMaker but I never felt like I had enough control over the functionality, sometimes I even felt like using GameMaker was cheating. So I decided to go ahead and use C++ and some of its libraries to make this, my first "real" prototype.

Project Gameplay:	Whack-A-Mole is a game in which the user must try to "whack", or click, as many moles as possible before 9 of them manage to escape. As it is a prototype, there is not much user interface and the game exits after the 9th mole escapes.

The files included are:

	wam.cpp:
		This is the main file which calls everything else.
	cSDL_Setup.cpp & cSDL_Setup.h:
		These files are for setting up SDL2. Aside from the specific window information in cSDL_Setup.cpp,
		these files can be re-used to set up SDL for another project.
	main.cpp & main.h:
		main.h sets up all the variables and main.cpp defines all of the game's functionality. cMain(), the 
		constructor loads up all of the information and gameLoop() process clicks and time to manipulate the
		scoreboard and the moles.
	tons of bmp/png files:
		PNG issue was solved for v0.2, but size will not be affected in the slightest. Good to know how to get 
		PNG's to work for the future, but I'll keep the bmp files that are already in use.

Updates:

	v0.2. 	- Got PNG's to work by adding appropriate .dll's to the directory. All images used for the moles 
	are now PNG's with transparency. Added -mwindows to Makefile. No more command line prompt coming up after 
	clicking the executable.

	v0.3	- Start menu is now up. The game no longer closes after losing.

	v0.4	- Added high score system. 1 high score is kept, easily hackable, might added an encryption key later.
	Changed number images to png's.
